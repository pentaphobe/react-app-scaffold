# Getting setup

## Installation

Should just be a matter of `yarn`

## Running

`yarn start`

## Todo

- [x] Function wrapper for theme values inside styles
    - [x] should allow basic processing values (scaling, blending) regardless of units
- [ ] Template ultimately needs to be more meta
    - [ ] currently the package is too visible (fnerr fnerr), so most of what's currently here needs to be a dependency of the final product
